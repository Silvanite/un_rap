### Weigh your containers

Bring any container you like â€“ jars, Tupperware, lunchboxes, canvas bags, cotton produce bags, paper bags, reusable plastic bags, etc. We are huge advocates of reusing over recycling, so if it can be weighed, it can be used to refill.

We do offer paper bags free of charge, just in case you forget your containers, or you need something as you pass. These can be recycled or composted at home. Many people use these several times.

People donate their empty jars and you can take them free of charge.
